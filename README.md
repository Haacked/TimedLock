TimedLock
=========

A Lock structure with timeout and stack traces in case of deadlock

Here's the original blog post that introduces the concept from Ian Griffiths.

* [http://www.interact-sw.co.uk/iangblog/2004/03/23/locking](http://www.interact-sw.co.uk/iangblog/2004/03/23/locking)

I wrote a series of blog posts trying to improve on this.

* [A lock statement with timeout](http://haacked.com/archive/2004/03/26/lock-statement-with-timeout.aspx/)
* [A TimedLock success story](http://haacked.com/archive/2004/08/06/timedlock-success-story.aspx/)
* [TimedLock Revisited](http://haacked.com/archive/2004/04/17/timedlock-revisited.aspx/)
* [TimedLock Yet Again Revisited...](http://haacked.com/archive/2004/05/12/timedlock_yet_again_revisited.aspx/)
* [TimedLock with stack traces strikes back](http://haacked.com/archive/2004/10/13/TimedLockWithStackTracesStrikesBack.aspx/)

I finally moved the code into this Repository.
